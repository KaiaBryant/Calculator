// extract data-input, data-operator and all ID's


// 1. when user clicks button, it will invoke eventlistener 'click'
// 2. From the button that was called turn that value into inputs to turn into a string
// 3.  then, I want to slice the string to get each input 
// 4. the input operator will be triggered based on the operator found in that string using if/esle
// 5. once passed, equal will return output/calculation 
// NOTE: percentage is value / 100
// NOTE: exponent is value ** value 
// NOTE: handle errors like two operators next to each other
